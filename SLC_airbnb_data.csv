Self check-in with both exterior and interior door codes was convenient and felt safe. Kitchen is VERY well stocked with dishes, utensils, cookware, and containers. The bed was SO comfortable, and I appreciated the conveniences of the AC unit in the room and the smart tv! The bandaid-colored epoxied cement floors were a weird choice, but the room was well-furnished and comfortable. I did have a mild issue with cleanliness, but after some communication with the host, the problem was resolved. The host is a real estate group that has 453 listings on Airbnb (as of this moment anyway), so be aware that you should just reach out to the local contact they provide instead of using the Airbnb messenger. I would stay here again in the future!"",""Nice place to stay. Very nearby of the shopping center, park and coffee shop.<br/>I highly recommend it."",""The place is as-advertised.

The Airbnb does not have 2 cameras as it claims to. The host was largely unhelpful in the matter. The only camera they have has poor visibility. Pretty much ruined the rest of my trip as I still have no ID, credit cards, etc.. This is on top of all the personal items that were stolen that I will never be able to replace. <br/><br/>Conclusion: If you don’t mind the possibility of someone breaking into your vehicle (it was my second night of the first stop of a solo cross country road trip) and not getting any help from the rental company then maybe this place is for you.

Lots of half-measures: bedroom is very hot but you’ll be provided with one of the cheapest fans on the market. AC is intensely loud. You’ll be sharing a narrow driveway with strangers (other guests, visitors, etc) who probably won’t proactively care enough to make sure you can get in and out of the driveway. Construction was happening on the site with lots of debris (including broken glass) left in the yard for several days. Sidewalk path overgrown by branches and weeds but when it was trimmed, all the clippings were left on the path/steps. You’ll be encouraged to walk through the lawn to get in and out of the unit; the path will be dark and often wet/muddy. Several of the pots & pans had scratched coatings or missing handles. Overall, no unsafe issues, but I don’t think the hosts were as proactive as I’ve experienced elsewhere or interested in excellence.

While we were able to walk and get groceries, on our last day, my wife and I separated for a mere couple minutes walking on the same road this Airbnb is on only to have a creepy guy pull up to her offering her money to get inside his car. We had to call the cops.<br/><br/>While this is a superhost, I really liked their automated messages at first to make sure we were having a good stay, but one of the automated messages was to kindly offer suggestions for improvement. We suggested something but was never acknowledged. It doesn't matter if the suggestion was implemented, but to be ignored rubbed me the wrong way. Especially since there are three hosts that could have responded and they were relatively quick to respond on everything else. A simple \""thanks for your feedback.\"" would have gone a long way.<br/><br/>We almost tried to stay one more night so we didn't have to pack up yet, but glad we didn't.  The cleaning fee is almost the same price as advertised for the place itself. We were charged $55 for the cleaning fee which we sucked up when we booked the place, but upon checkout, the host sent an automated message for cleaning instructions! Now we aren't trashy people and we did wash our dishes, but to be expected to wash our own sheets and take out the trash? Why are we paying for a cleaning fee? I would either charge significantly less for the cleaning fee or not expect the guests to do the laundry or take out the trash.  One or the other.

We checked in just fine. Although we had to carry our heavy luggage up stairs to the 3rd floor of the apartment complex. <br/><br/>Right after we checked in, we run into a problem - the lock didn't work so we couldn't leave the apartment. I reached out to Lauren and it took me a couple tries so she would believe me that the lock is not working (both, my friend and I spent about half an hour trying to lock the door). Finally, the handyman came.<br/> It was about 8pm, we were tired after long distance driving and wanted to rest. But instead were listening the noise while handyman was trying to fix the lock. After he finished he just walked through the living room without even asking us if it was ok for him to walk in inside.<br/><br/>After that i reached out to Lauren asking if there will be some reimbursement for our troubles. She assured me that they would take care of it as customer satisfaction is their top priority. Unfortunately, it never happened.<br/><br/>They charge additionaly for each guest and for each extra hour of you staying there but they will not reimburse you for wasting your time and discomfort.<br/><br/>2. The second problem appeared right after. The air conditioner was  running all the time non stop just blowing air. In the morning it was 74 degrees. All 4 of us woke up in the morning with a headache as apartment was overheated and there were no fresh air. <br/><br/>I reached out to Lauren and asked if someone could come and fix it. She just offered us to control the heat ourselves. <br/><br/>So, since the air conditioning was not working we had only 2 options: to turn it off or to listen to the loud noise non stop that was doing nothing. So we turned it off. <br/><br/>We were waking up with headaches 2 mornings in a row. Than i gave up and paid for an additiona hotel room and moved out 3 night before the end of stay.<br/><br/>This stay was a total nightmare.<br/>Since it was nonrefundable i ended up paying for 2 places and it cost me almost $2 000 for 5 nights in Salt Lake and headache because of overheating for 2 days.<br/><br/>I travel a lot and usually stay through airbnb and i ALWAYS have great experience. Unfortunately not this time. I paid way over $200 a night staying in this place as they charged additionally for each guest plus they are very firm for you to check out before 11am or you will be charged additionally per each hour ... for this money i could stay in a very nice room at Marriott or Grand America and would have a much better experience and i could even extend a few more hours free of charge. <br/><br/>Positive things: the appartment is clean, well equipped and well furnished.

This charming apartment was the perfect home base for our week in SLC. <br/><br/>The apartment makes up the second floor of the house and is full of character—a turret, arched entryways, chandeliers, ceiling medallions. That may not matter to some, but it appealed to me. <br/><br/>Beyond the aesthetic, the place was also practical. It is spacious (the two of us had loads more space than needed) and is well stocked. The kitchen has cookware, silverware, appliances, etc. to make cooking and eating in easy. The bathroom has a good stock of toilet paper, towels, and hair/body wash. In addition to the three bedrooms, there was also a nice living room area with a tv. <br/><br/>The apartment was also comfortable as it had nice bedding and furniture. The space has air conditioning which was a nice bonus during a week of 100-degree weather in July. <br/><br/>Michael was an excellent host who made check-in simple and convenient. He also communicated with me throughout my stay to update me about a minor internet issue. I was so appreciative of this. <br/><br/>I cannot express how at home I felt in this apartment.

The upstairs bathroom would get a little cold at night (outside temp was low 20s) but was warm in the daytime.<br/>The location is perfect - walking distance (1/4 to 1/2 mile) to restaurants and a supermarket.  The park and surrounding neighborhoods are great for walking with some great views of the spectacular Wasatch Mountains.<br/>Negatives were some traffic noise from the street out front especially at morning rush hour. The bedrooms are fairly well sound insulated, but we used the earplugs provided in a jar next to the bed by the host to eliminate the noise. As others have mentioned the stairs are somewhat narrow adding some difficulty to carrying luggage upstairs, but I didn't have any trouble with height and I'm 6'2\"". I did have to bend a little going around the bed in the larger bedroom because of ceiling slope, but this was not really a problem.<br/>We loved staying in this house and highly recommend it to other couples or small families."",""I had a great stay.

It was confusing to check-in and find the place, and confusing to park using the gate card (which didn't even work). The hallways were dirty and covered in sticky spills of some sort ---not Kylie's fault, but this isn't as nice of a place as advertised. The elevators and staircases for the gated parking are not at all convenient to the unit, and we often had to wait for another guest to come park and open the gate just so we could get in. The bed seemed like a full-size not even a queen --- so a bit small for a couple to sleep. The toilet seat was not latched down properly and shifted off the toilet with use -- gross.<br/><br/>2) The amenities are so far away from the unit it was impractical to use them. Additionally, the pool is only 3 feet deep, so you can't really swim --- and it was closed for some unexplained reason --- and even if it was open, it wasn't something worth paying extra $$$ for. The FOB to get into the game room didn't work either. So, we paid a lot of money for basically nothing. <br/><br/>3) And this is the one that really gets me... Like many travelers arriving via air, our flight arrived in the late morning/early afternoon, nothing unusual. After receiving Kylie's confirmation email, which asked for approximate check-in times and accommodations, I kindly responded with our info and asked for a very reasonable early check-in (around 12 or 1pm) as we had nowhere to put our things. Most hotels/AirBnBs will graciously allow for an early check-in assuming the room is ready and there are no guests prior. I would completely understand if that were not the case, and they needed the time to prep the room. However, the apartment was in fact *ready* with *no guests* the days prior to our arrival. So rather than being kind and helpful towards us, Kylie up-charged me an additional $35 fee for an early check-in and for no good reason. Prior to this, she threatened a $75 up-charge and implied it should be a whole extra day's extra charge for some unknown reason (...again, I was only asking for two hours early --- insane --- try reading your guests' messages fully and comprehending them before being so rigid and unkind). <br/><br/>If you are not going be accommodating, and are going force your guests to either wander the city hauling their luggage around or pay more money for a just a couple of hours, then please don't send an initial email kindly asking for check-in/ETA only to then exploit your guests for more money. We had no choice but to pay this ridiculous fee as we had nowhere else to put our things. After explaining that we had nowhere to put our luggage or anywhere to go for a couple of hours, Kylie showed no concern and just said \""you are welcome to pay the $35 fee\""). While prompt, I found her email responses to be lacking in helpfulness, kindness, and genuine concern for her guests. This is entirely her choice to be this way, but it would have been helpful to have explained how rigid and unaccommodating you would be in your listing, rather than waiting until I had already booked it through AirBnB and you had taken my money. It felt like I had to ask Kylie to confirm everything once I paid this fee, rather than her confirming and making us feel welcome. After paying this fee, she did allow for an extra hour to check-out on the last day, but I also had to respond reconfirming the extra hour to check-out as her exit message threatened additional fees --- not cool and your guests shouldn’t have to remind you of *your* agreements --- you should be keeping track of that.<br/><br/>4) Overall, the unit is \""okay,\"" but the cost per night, with a rather hefty $100 cleaning fee (unusually high for AirBnB), and a ridiculous $35 early check-in fee with no understanding or help for us to put our valuables, all made this experience pretty bad overall. I would encourage Kylie to work on her communication and customer service skills as her rather \""tongue-in-cheek\"" responses made us feel unwelcome and anxious prior to and during our trip. I am having a hard time believing all of the positive reviews are even real, as this was not even remotely close to our experience.""]",4.8,4.7,4.8,4.7,4.4,4.7,4:00:00 PM,11:00:00 AM,3,Entire rental unit,2,1,1 bedroom,2 beds,1 bathroom

Communication was fine, but the apartment did not have the standard cleaning. <br/>First, you have to go through a garage storage area protected by a wooden fence to get to it (didn’t seem the safest). Then, the front main door to apartment only shuts when locked and was open upon arrival. <br/>Bath Tub was clogged and wouldn’t drain. Had to turn off water multiple times to allow for drainage during my shower. The shower curtain was disgusting and looked like it hasn’t been changed for months. The coffee pot was dirty with old used grounds in it and the pot itself was dirty. I couldn’t clean it because there was no sponge. Silverware had old crusted food on it. Pillows were stained and dirty which could be seen by the naked eye since the pillow cases didn’t cover the pillow. <br/>Lastly, the hosts are very strict with no noise past 10pm, which was fine since I needed to be up so early for work. However, the main bedroom must be under their room as I heard VERY LOUD footsteps all night long into the early morning. You could also hear them literally using the toilet (you can hear the pee). So, I didnt get sleep. The hosts clearly aren’t mindful that we can hear everything - that or they didn’t care.<br/>I usually never complain nor leave reviews, but everyone should know before booking this apartment. I don’t know how it got the stars it did, but I checked out the very next morning and called AirBnB for a refund. <br/>The hosts did try to contact me and say sorry, but they blew it off as “you should have let us know and we could have fixed the issues” and “the cleaners dont drink coffee so they probably didn’t know to check it haha” - they literally gave this excuse and said haha after all the chaos I dealt with, it is not funny.

Would recommend."",""I am dividing my review into two parts, the room itself and the  building it is located in. While the room had a few inconvenient problems I have serious concerns about the building and its security and safety. <br/><br/>The room-<br/>The room was clean although beware that the room does have an essential oil diffuser which is problematic for people with allergies and asthma. The room does have very little storage space, there is no dresser to unpack clothes and only about 4 clothes hangers in the closet, so if you have clothes you need to hang or sort it is not the easiest to do. Also, there is no storage closet beyond the small one for your clothes, so if you have any gear you need to store there isn't space for this. There is also no bedside table or shelf for storage of nightly medical items. Otherwise, there is everything you need. <br/><br/>The building-<br/>I am a female who travels alone on the regular. I take a few very specific precautions when I do. The biggest one being that I look for secured parking structures when I know I will be coming and going at late hours. The building is suppose to have a remote access garage door. The door was in the up and open position the entire time of my stay. This made the parking area feel very insecure. After my first night, I noticed a wall next to the door I was using had been vandalized with a drawing referencing the parking structure, and \""death is coming\"". Let's just say I always had mace in my hand after that.   Add to that, there is no signage pointing you towards which doors will get you to elevators, stairwells, etc. so you are left to wander and try doors in order to locate the correct one. The stairwells themselves are also problematic as the doors leading from the stairwells into the garage are difficult to open. One that I tried to use was stuck making me feel trapped in the stairwell. Additionally, there was garbage in the stairwell that was not collected or moved during my stay suggesting that no management or security was monitoring the stairwell. During my first night stay, there was a group down the hall yelling and screaming at midnight with sounds of items being tossed about. While it says the unit enforces noise through decibel level monitors, it did not seem to do much good. The morning before my checkout, I was awakened by the fire department banging on the door a few apartments down. I am not sure why they were there, but it seemed like there was a major water clean-up occurring as I checked out and left the premises. <br/><br/>All in all, while Kylie's space is fine, but the building it is located in and their practices makes this a very unsafe space for women traveling alone."",""生活和交通非常便利顺畅。"",""Very, very cozy spot. Visited SLC for the weekend with a friend. Both the pull-out couch and the bed itself we very comfortable. Parking was easy and hassle free. Working with Kylie was very pleasant.

I work in the hospitality industry and have had nothing but positive experiances with Airbnb, Till now.<br/>I should have left the monent I arrived.  the grounds were a mess. An entite fallen tree, busted up concrete, awning laying on the ground and a refigerator sitting outside. I look trashy like nothing had been done since the fall.(even a pumpkin still there)  I woundered if they knew i was coming. After a 9 hour drive i'm greeted by an ice box. no heat at all. A space like that will take hours to warm up. Yes the place was clean and yes they did provide a space heater but at $150.00 per night should't need a space heater.<br/><br/>The space was far from \""chic\"" as described. It looks like it was done as cheaply as possiable. All white, blazingly brights lights, no color, not a single decoartive element., no table lamp NOTHING that woud show they were trying to provide a pleasing  environment. Only hard wooden chairs to sit. Not a relaxing space after working all day.<br/><br/>So many odd things about thing place like the two electric gates that you had to get out of your car twice to open eack one. Their soultion\""Park on the street\"". The water presure was usualy a trickel and then it would be fine. There was a spot light aiming into the glass entry door (no shade) that i asked several time to have turned off because it made it diffucult to sleep. It was  turnd off then later turned back on. I was angry to discover it was a camera.  <br/><br/>The entire time i had a sense I was being watched. after a week I just hated the place.I finaly had it when returen after a hike sunday and the door key pad to be compleatly inopeerative.  My imediate reaction was they were not happy that I covered the camera facing the door and deactivated the lock. When i texted, it was working again. <br/><br/>It was just too weird and  trashy.   It seem the only interest the owner has is $$ and not about his guests.I packed and went to another hotel.<br/><br/>They have made it dificult to get any resoultion by giving me the runaround. I wanted a refund for  5 days.   I also discovered structures like this do not require to meet code or inspection.<br/><br/>all around bad!"",""We arrived to find the home with dirty linens on the floor. We contacted the host and they offered us a new place or this one cleaned promptly. We chose the cleaning option, and they had it “cleaned” by 9pm. We initially thought all was well, except the heat was off in <30 degree weather upon our return and the house was very cold with only a quick cleaning job done. The next evening, we realized there was no laundry detergent in the house and the washer defaulted to the last used setting, rinse + spin, indicating the linens had only been rinsed.  When we attempted resolution after the stay, the host accused us of lying about our complaints and refused any refund. My husband and I do not typically leave reviews unless they are positive as we understand that mistakes happen and try to give people the benefit of the doubt. However, given their gross misrepresentation of the cleanliness of the home and their blatant disregard for our concerns, we opted to leave an honest review. Hopefully they will change their behavior after this event and your experience will be better."",""Loved my tiny home stay!! A really fun experience as a solo traveler. It was a cozy stay in the winter, I’m sure it’s just perfect in the warmer seasons when you can use full advantage of the deck! Also conveniently located 10-15 minutes from pretty much everywhere in SLC."",""Sadly, this is the first negative review I’ve ever written since joining AirBnb. There is no malice intended in this review- it’s just that I would hate for anyone else to have to experience the physical discomfort and stress that we unknowingly signed up for when we booked with this host. Communication with the host was stressful and frustrating- their apathy made it apparent that their guest’s comfort and experience is not a priority to them.  I don’t want anyone else to be left with the choices we were left with: to either suck it up and freeze by seeing their stay through, or taking on the unplanned financial burden of having to find a new stay at the last minute…in addition to the inconvenience of having to relocate. <br/><br/>     While the tiny home was clean and as pictured, what isn’t pictured is how cold it is inside and that there isn’t hot water in the shower.  It was January- both of those things are crucial. <br/><br/>     We arrived late our first night,  which is when we realized there was no hot water and that the unit isn’t sufficiently heated. Out of respect, we waited until the AM to reach out to the host. The host wasn’t at all helpful- one of the responses I received re: the fact that there was no hot water was,” There is unlimited hot water available. It's a tankless unit.  Just move the shower handle to the hot side by rotating it counter clockwise (to the right).  Let the water run for a moment and then you'll feel the hot water.” I’m not an idiot, and I had done this before reaching out. The host then offered me another unit for the night, but when I asked to see the listing for the unit they had in mind (to see if it would suit our needs), the host sent a string of texts such as,”The mode choices are Heat, AC, Off, or Auto.  Select either Heat or Auto.  Then choose a higher temperature, then your interior space will be very warm.” Here’s the problem with what the host was saying: There are two AC/Heat units in the tiny home. They are both installed on the same side of the unit, and one of them is in the upper loft area. The host doesn’t seem to understand that heat rises, it doesn’t slope down to a lower level. So, even with both units at max temp and fan speed, we were freezing as it was in the low 30s outside. They offered to send the maintenance man over but we had already spoken to him as he was doing work on the property. The maintenance man was helpful in explaining why we weren’t receiving the hot water at a desired temperature as the unit isn’t supplied with enough electrical power to heat the water during the dead of winter. He also explained that the AC/Heater units need to be placed in areas that follow the basic laws of thermodynamics. <br/><br/>     Ultimately, we were forced to find a new Airbnb as it was too cold to be anywhere other than the bedroom with the door closed and the unit on max heat. We left the unit spotless and requested reimbursement only for that (2nd) night. At that point, all communication from the host ceased. <br/><br/>     I have now been playing phone tag with AirBnb’s Customer Service team for 2 weeks. I’ve yet to make phone contact with the Customer Service Reps as it’s impossible for me to answer calls when treating patients & my work days extend beyond their scheduled hours. <br/><br/>    We are now into a new month, and the whole experience with this host was and continues to be a stress and complete inconvenience. <br/><br/>     One more thing to note- there is a motion-activated security camera that is pointed at the front door of the tiny home. The front door has a large glass panel, and the hosts didn’t put blinds on the door. There is no privacy. A light is activated when the camera is turned on, but the light randomly turned on throughout the night. Be very careful where you change.""]",4.5,4.1,3.7,4.7,4.1,3.6,4:00:00 PM,11:00:00 AM,4,Home,2,1,1 bedroom,2 beds,1 bathroom

A quick drive to other wonderful spots such as Ensign Peak Park. If you want a taste of city living, I recommend staying here. As the owner states in the description, city noises are present.

Don’t hesitate to stay here 🫶🏾👏🏾"",""The price, location, bed, and apartment were all good, but a few mechanical and execution issues we encountered were aggravating and keep me from giving a higher score. I think these can be easily fixed and I have shared this feedback with the owner to improve. These included:<br/>- Garage entry door card didn’t work from within my car. I had to exit car and hold up card near sensor to get door to open. Other residents I asked did not have this problem with their cards. This was not fixed during my stay.  <br/>- Door lock / keypad mechanism sometimes didn’t work on several tries due to issue with alignment between lock and door frame. <br/>- Stocking of some basics like paper towels, TP, dishwasher soap, kitchen sponge, and washcloths was not enough for 5 night stay which I booked. <br/>- Bedding not provided initially for pull out couch (I had communicated that we needed the pull out made for a 3rd person daughter with us). <br/><br/>If these issues had not been encountered then I think I could give a better recommendation."",""Great location with secure and safe parking! The apartment was of nice value. The cleanliness was okay. A previous guest's sock was still on the bedroom floor and the walls against the bed were a little smudged and dirty. Very few/limited cleaning supplies available for the guests to use. Bring your own laundry detergent if you intend to use the listed amenity. A little impersonal, but it was a very efficient and easy place to stay.

You were quick to provide information and support when requested in a way that made it easy to get myself situated for my stay.  The suite is well-stocked, very clean, with a comfortable bed.  The private entrance and being separate from your home allowed me to come and go without worrying about disrupting your family.  An easy walk to amenities at the City Creek Mall, and to the major sightseeing and research facilities for the LDS church and those doing genealogical research. The location also has some well kept green spaces, parks nearby.  I hope to return for a future stay. Thanks!""]",4.9,4.8,4.9,5,5,4.9,4:00:00 PM,10:00:00 AM,2,Guesthouse,1,1,Studio,1 bed,1 bathroom

There were only 2 plates, 2 forks, 2 towels, 0 pillowcases and empty soap containers for the 3 of us staying in the apartment. We also had to ask for lightbulbs (we had to change 9 when we got there). The internet only worked when no one else was staying in the other units since it’s shared. These were all things that should’ve been taken care of before we checked in. The cabinets were full of old, expired, opened food that we had to toss and we had to clean up spilled honey that was all over one of the cabinets and everything else inside. <br/><br/>Other things that should be fixed- the drip in the fridge that we had to keep a bowl to catch the water and empty every other day, the dryer that makes the loudest noise when in use, the ac filter needs changed and smells like wet dog when on, the microwave worked for the first 3 weeks (however you had to put something in for 4 minutes that a normal microwave would take 30 seconds since it’s so old) but stopped working our last week, some of the tiles are cracked and move when you walk on them. <br/><br/>We chose this Airbnb because of the garage however the parking situation was not easy. It is a shared driveway that is constantly getting blocked by the house in the back/other Airbnb guests/housekeeping/maintenance/neighbors. One day someone parked in the driveway and left the property making it impossible to get our car out and having to Uber to work. The other frustrating thing is that maintenance uses the room in the garage to store their tools and used it on a regular basis even though our car was parked in there. When we asked the maintenance man about not going into the garage he said he “had to because it’s where he keeps his tools and Skyler doesn’t know what happens on the property”. <br/><br/>We travel for work and stay in Airbnb’s 50 weeks/year.

It took around 40 minutes to get to the mountains (we have an Ikon pass) and 10 minutes to anywhere you need to go in salt lake (groceries, bars, coffee/cafes, restaurants, etc.). Residential neighborhood located a couple blocks away from the Liberty Park (very nice). You have really nice neighbors to each side of you that we never heard while in the apartment since the walls are so thick! The apartment seems bigger then what the pictures show which was a nice surprise. Lots of storage and space which we definitely used during our month there. It even has a small private outdoor space which we didn’t use since it was too cold but I’m sure it’s great when it’s nice out! Catherine stocked everything very well and everything you needed was there - washer/dryer in the bathroom, kitchen supplies, coffee machine & extra bedding/pillows! Our favorite was the pull out coach she had in the living room which we kept in the bed set up when we watched TV. So comfy! We would definitely come back!"",""Catherine's place was perfect for a long stay. Great location close to Liberty Park, the mountains, and downtown, plenty of dishes and cooking supplies. She is a great host and responded promptly. I hope to be able to stay again in the future!"",""The apartment is chopped up a bit which is actually really nice. The pictures kind of portray it different but there is one bedroom and the kitchen and living room are separated by a wall. The area is a bit iffy as well.. just watch your surroundings!! We enjoyed our stay over all though! Catherine was very quick at responding to questions/issues and cares about the people that stay in her place!!"",""Had super good communication with Catherine for anything I needed during the stay, would stay again! :)""]",4.6,4.6,4.9,4.5,4.9,4.6,3:00:00 PM,10:00:00 AM,3,Entire rental unit,4,1,1 bedroom,4 beds,1 bathroom

Downstairs got very cold, and apparently heat was out for that area while I was visiting, but the loft Master Bedroom was SUPER cozy and warm. 5/5 would recommend, and would stay here again!"",""Sattar was very pleasant during our interactions and the neighbor/land manager who lives next door was also. However I felt the reviews and description left a lot to be desired. I have lots of photos of spider webs, small spiders and dirt in every window seal at check in, the velvet headboards also dusty, no vacuum provided to clean yourself, the laundry soap provided was covered in soap and debris and hair from previous renters… I assume. The neighborhood is definitely going through gentrification and I’m sure will be cute in a year or so, but the area is not walkable; especially for a young female. There are lots of homeless people around, and construction on every corner. The homeless never bothered me personally and I had no issues with them but this location is NOT 9th and 9.  The dumpster behind the Airbnb was lit on fire twice while I was there. If it weren’t for the outrageous cleaning fees and prices people are trying to charge for these half done airbnbs I wouldn’t mind small things but the price gouging accompanied with lack of attention to detail just isn’t worth the price  it for me. If you’re staying here long term be aware upstairs has a high turn over of visitors that are here to party and it’s very noisy. 😊 a little white noise machine takes care of most of it."",""Windows have blinds, which I figured they would, but you can’t see that in the photos listed. Place was perfect - clean, had everything I needed. I was requested to strip the slept-in bed of sheets and wash the dishes I used before I left. I felt safe and I would stay there again."",""When I arrived, it was late and cold, I could not get into the door with my code since the battery had died in the keypad. I texted the management company and they kept trying to say I was doing it wrong. I had to get batteries from the keypad in the front to get into my place. Once in, it had not been clean since the last tenets that were there in November. The bed was unmade, dirty towel and dishes. There was even men’s dirty underwear in the bed! A housekeeper was called to come and do a quick clean, but she was very flustered and uncomfortable that we were there while she was working. I was also paying $3000 a month while staying as a travel nurse and was denied the management company providing me any basic paper products, I had to buy my own because, “long term guests don’t get that amenity”. The door knob batteries also died at one point and twice I was provided with the wrong batteries to replace it. I had to buy them myself. The management company accused the owner of not understanding much English, and not understanding the battery situation properly. It would also be nice if the airbnb upstairs knew I existed downstairs, I had to knock on the door a couple of times to ask people to quiet down after quiet hours because I had to be up at 5 in the morning. A housekeeper even showed up at 11pm to clean after guests upstairs left, you can hear everything being moved. Other than these events, the place is convenient to many downtown locations, good restaurants, the light rail was out back, making it easy to get to the airport. It was nice for just me to stay in during my travel assignment. I do wish the management company did a better job of making my stay nicer, I felt brushed off, or annoying, anytime I reached out. I would more recommend it for a short stay rather than a long one."",""The place was nice, clean and comfortable!"",""The place was nice and clean. The check in process was not a smooth as others I have experienced. The location is relatively central but in order to get to most places you have to walk through some shady areas. We ended up having to Uber because at night it didn’t feel safe. The front door opens up to the tram tracks so there would be homeless people hanging out and there was dog poop all over the front yard that seemed to be accumulating daily. The actual apartment was nice but for surrounding area did not match its value."",""Cute studio with ample space for four people (but it was just two of us on this trip) and nice touches to the kitchen. We went in knowing about the noise from other reviews about the upstairs tenants - we didn’t mind it (heavy sleepers). We overall enjoyed experiencing SLC while staying here. <br/><br/>We had some hiccups with checking in and took us about 15-20 minutes to access the unit. Contacted the owner and was forwarded to voicemail - unfortunately, his mailbox was full. However, we got in contact with Courtney and she immediately helped us get into the unit smoothly. <br/><br/>Parking was very convenient. The property is close enough to many establishments that we were able to walk and grab coffee and food, as well as being centrally located to Downtown SLC.""]",4.8,4.6,4.5,4.7,4.4,4.7,4:00:00 PM,10:00:00 AM,4,Guestsuite,2,1,Studio,1 bed,1 bathroom

The location is only a 20 min walk to downtown and I could easily find lime scooters to get downtown and back. <br/>They messaged me the day before my arrival letting me know the AC was broken but they were able to fix it, however, the AC vent is quite loud in the unit. I had to hide air freshners as I am quite sensitve to artifical fragrances so that definitely gave me a headache. The worst part of my stay was the neighbours dog who would bark endlessly when the owners left. The dog barked non-stop on Saturday night from 10 pm - 2 am. There was also many bags of dog poop that were left right outside the unit's entrance. Not sure if it was the neighbours or someone else. The AirBnB manager did let me know they would file a complaint in a timely manner when I let them know."",""I spent a week at this property and had a great experience. The property was immaculately clean, described accurately in the listing, and was nicely spacious for my solo trip. I worked from home on a few of those days and found the small table and seating reasonably comfortable with a laptop. The internet quality was very stable and fast, 100Mbit+ and I had no problems using Zoom or streaming 4K video. The bed was plenty comfortable, and the kitchen had all the essentials I needed. The off-street parking is shared with other units in the building, and I had to park on the street a few blocks away for two nights of my stay. The unit gets limited natural light due to all the windows facing a building about five feet away but there is very good overhead interior lighting, so the unit never felt dark inside. The location is in a great location for both driving and walking with plenty of restaurants and bars within a reasonable walk."",""Spacious, clean, and well-appointed! Close proximity to several terrific coffee shops.  Thanks for a great stay, Maven!"",""This place was adorable! I have high expectations for airbnb stays, and this place was absolutely amazing. It was very central to everything in SLC. Check in and check out was extremely easy. I was worried about parking, but that was just as easy! There is free street parking in front of the building or the designated spots. The place is very cozy. I loved all of the toiletries (shower care, body/bath oil, and feminine products).

871,"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States",Stays,4,"[{""name"":""Evolve is a Superhost"",""value"":""Superhosts are experienced, highly rated hosts who are committed to providing great stays for guests.""}]",40.76551,"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States",-111.89533,1,109,USD$101 - 200,4.11,"[""Very cute place. Had everything we needed and was right across the street from the convention center where our event was. That made it super convenient. A little trouble getting in, but over all was a great place."",""In line with other reviewers the check process was miserable. The check in sheet is completely inaccurate. Do not expect the key to be found anywhere outside the building. The contact for the listing, as provided on the sheet, was completely unreachable. Evolve, the manager of the listing on Airbnb, thankfully was reachable and was able to get me into the building. My advice is just call and /or message evolve directly and tell them you are going to need the  number for the building call box to contact a person in the building who will buzz you in, from that point the lock box will be next to the listing door. <br/><br/>Also in line with previous reviews, the door fob did not work at all. You will have to use the garage lot buzzer to get in and out. Evolve tried to help me, but again the actual contact for the property was unreachable so the fob never got fixed. I hope the evolve can address the issues with whoever is supposed to be the owner and contact person for this listing. <br/><br/>Other than that the place was great. Loved the space and good location for the city. I just can’t recommend the listing with the communication issues."",""Pros: It’s across the street from the Salt Palace Convention Center, this is why we picked it.<br/>Cons: Evolve doesn’t communicate well. They sent us photos & the night we arrived the keys weren’t placed where the photos showed they would be. We had to call Airbnb, who called Evolve several times, but Evolve never responded until the next day, so we slept in our van in the alley, not a pleasant experience at all! Airbnb did ask Evolve to refund us the first night & they did. <br/>The 2nd BIG problem was that once we got the keys, the fob & the clicker, that we would need to get in the building, the Fob didn’t work from day one!<br/>I immediately reached out to Evolve & asked if they could get us a replacement because we were staying for 5 days & they said, “that won’t be possible.”<br/>So they gave us a code to get in the front door, but there were actually 2 doors to go thru before you got to the elevator. So they told us that we would need to go quickly to get thru the 2 doors or else the time would run out & we would have to start over. The problem is that the code only worked about Half of the time!<br/>Our family has been attending this conference for over 10 yrs, so we chose this place specifically because it would be easy to go across the street several times a day.<br/>But unfortunately because the Fob didn’t work at all & the code only worked half the time, we had to go thru the alley, where there was homeless people & use the Garage clicker to go thru the back of the building. <br/>This was unpleasant because of the homeless people who were in the narrow alley. Our other choice was to go the long way down the street, where there was also homeless people. Also, you needed two people because there are 2 doors & they aren’t close together, so one person had to hold one door open, while the other person went to the front door to let the rest us in the building.<br/>It was a HUGE inconvenience, to say the least.<br/>Otherwise, the unit is quiet, clean & comfortable. It is a loft, but they make good use of the small space.<br/>If it weren’t for the issue of getting in the building & the company Evolve, who never reached out to us, we would’ve really liked this space.<br/>We did see other people from the conference staying in other apartments, but I didn’t know them & never had the opportunity to ask them who they rented from? But their key fobs did work."",""Check in will be a hassle. Just plan on it. You probably will have limited access to the building after you finally check in. Expect it. You can only be buzzed into the building by a mysterious stranger and the fob doesn't work for anything. The lockbox is inside the building, no longer at the garage entry so you will have to get instructions for how to be buzzed into the building to get the key. The only way you'll have to access the building is through the garage with the provided garage opener.<br/><br/>There are smells. <br/><br/>However, the beds and bedding were clean. The couch was comfy. The kitchen was decently stocked. The location was awesome and if you’re lucky enough to be there on a stormy night, open the windows and listen as the city quiets from obnoxious, insecure owners of reviving engines to thunder and rain on the empty city streets."",""The price is comparable to a boutique hotel in the area, without the same safety or quality of experience - so next time I'll PASS.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Overall this is a poor experience probably due to this condo being managed by 2 different companies, who I don't think have ever been in the space or communicate with one another. You are given a number and email to a property manager who isn't able to resolve issues onsite. There's someone else managing the Airbnb messages. There's no need for it to be so confusing.<br/>-The check-in instructions are inaccurate. They sent maps, pictures, text instructions - which were incorrect.<br/>-my key fob didn't work which I reported as soon as I found out the first night, and they never resolved it. I used a garage door opener to walk in and out of the building's basement garage door (yea where cars exit) since I didn't have a key fob for my whole 4 day trip.  That's not a great feeling as a female. My preference is to enter and exit through well-lit main lobbies and elevators.<br/>-There were no utensils which I found odd because the apartment was well-stocked otherwise, with  coffee and everything. Usually I look for an Airbnb over a hotel (especially when costs are equal) because it feels more at home and there's a kitchen I can use. But no utensils at all, not even a spoon for the coffee, was odd. I did report it immediately and it wasn't resolved. <br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The apartment decor / interior was well done<br/>-they extended my checkout for about 2 hours which helped <br/><br/>Again, if comparing this stay to the cost of a chic boutique hotel in the area, I may as well do that and know that my problems will be resolved, that I'm safely able to enter and exit, and that I don't have to do my own cleanup at the end. I love Airbnb and have used it for so many years, all around the world and these  faceless management companies make it a poor experience."",""This property has a good location; however, we did not have a good experience there. Once we got there, it was a little challenging to find the lockbox for a key. The worst issue was, although the property mentioned cleanliness and covid policy, this property was not clean nor ready for us. It was not prepared for us and everything was used from previous people stayed there; ex. Blankets and bed sheets were used and messed up, towels were used and wet, some hair was on the beds, dirty bathroom, …<br/>The only good point other than the location of this property was the property reimbursed at least the cleaning fee. Also, the guest of this property (the phone number mentioned) was not responsive out of office hours either."",""Excellent location and walking distance from attractions and restaurants.""]",4.5,4.3,3.5,4.7,3.4,4.3,4:00:00 PM,10:00:00 AM,4,Condo,2,1,Studio,2 beds,1 bathroom

We will be back !"",""Mostly lovely."",""I feel compelled to expound on the wonderful experience that I had at this AirBnb during my 8 week stay during January and February 2021. <br/><br/>First, the location is fantastic. The AirBnb is located a short walk from Memorial Grove Park and the Utah state capitol. In addition, you are within walking distance of the Morman Temple and the downtown nightlife. To the West lies the Avenues and the University of Utah. I mainly spent my time skiing at the local resorts. Solitude and Brighton are ~45 min away, Alta and Snowbird are ~55 min away and Park City is ~1hr away without traffic. <br/><br/>The AirBnb is well furnished with a full sized refrigerator, stove, dish washer, toaster, toaster oven, and coffee maker. The dining area has a good sized table for eating and working and a large smart TV sits in front of a sitting area with a couch and chair. The AirBnb is one of two downstairs apartments and spans the right side of the building. Windows are present on three sides of the unit which results in plenty of light. Curtains provide privacy in the evenings. The unit was recently renovated and it shows. The kitchen was bright, modern, and easy to keep clean. Cooking pots, pans, and utensils were provided. The WiFi was adequate for working remotely and streaming TV. <br/><br/>What set this experience apart is the supplies included with the stay. I was provided with trash bags, plenty of paper towels, dishwasher soap, dish soap and laundry detergent. The AirBnb owner also owns a nearby apartment four-plex and I was able to use the single washer and dryer in the basement to wash my belongings. This greatly cut down on my expenses and was very convenient. <br/><br/>If I had to find fault with my experience, I would have to comment about the beds. The queen mattress in the main bedroom was the softest I have ever experienced. The mattress sits directly on the frame without a box spring. I brought up this concern with the AirBnb host and she provided a firmer mattress pad for the bed. While I put the mattress pad on the bed, I spun the mattress 180 degrees to see if that would help. During this exercise, I noticed that the flooring in the bedroom dipped lower near the headboard and this was translated to the mattress. I suspect this was driving the uncomfort I experienced. Guests who stayed in the second bedroom reported some chilly drafts and beds that were sagging on one edge due to people sitting on that edge. I was able to spin these mattresses around as well. <br/><br/>However, my experience as a whole was fantastic. The host was responsive and provided a mattress pad and additional kitchen pots and bowls at my request. I do not hesitate when I state that this AirBnb and host represent the best of the AirBnb platform for longer term stays."",""Amazing location! We did not have a car for the whole trip and had no problems. The park near by is so beautiful and great for running/walking, and downtown is a 10 minute walk.

I had a chance to meet Debbie and she has a remarkable personality. She is full of joy and happiness which makes your stay very comfortable and enjoying."",""Great spot, centrally located with many amenities. Look forward to staying again soon!"",""I usually like to give good reviews. When I walk in, a place always starts with 5 stars and only major difficulties, disappointments, or complete variances from the description decreases that score. This place is nicely decorated and strong efforts were made in the surface appeal. Unfortunately, this place had more than a tolerable share of detractors. <br/><br/>Firstly, the description of the property includes “dedicated workspace”. From this, one should expect some reasonably typical office space. For instance, a desk near an outlet and a decent chair. This place had nothing even approaching that unless they were counting the tiny bar table and two rickety barstools? (More on those later.) Or perhaps they counted the bed or the short coffee table and uncomfortable couch? Dedicated workspace was something specifically needed on this trip. I feel that is a reasonable expectation for and “executive monthly rental” headline including the words “dedicated workspace”. I took off points for that. <br/><br/>Second, there isn’t a piece of furniture that’s comfortable in the whole place (or necessarily in good repair). The couch is a broken down hide-a-bed that is not at all comfortable to sit at. The bed was hard and unforgiving. It reminded me of beds I’d stayed on at cheap hostels when traveling in India. I had to go buy a foam mattress topper just to rest reasonably well. I took that home with me, sorry future tenants. There are also a lot of flimsy and/or broken pieces of furniture. For instance, the bench by the front entry has 2 broken legs. They must have known the first broke and turned it around before the second broke because they are kitty corner from each other. There were two barstools, one was sat on successfully and safely a few times. Then my sister went to sit on the other to visit with me while I was making dinner and it immediately and dangerously collapsed under her. She ended up bruised badly. The stool’s seat welds had broken before we got there and it hadn’t been taken care of, leaving guests to get injured. I feel that hosts should certainly inspect for damages between guests and resolve those issues before they become problems for the next guest. I took off more points for those issues. <br/><br/>Lastly, there are various other nuisances, like a sometimes dysfunctional tub and toilet, less than clean when we moved in, no warm water to the bathroom sink, almost not enough hot water to run a full bath, extremely poor water pressure, frequent noises as if a rock tumbler were running in the utility area, no potholders or kitchen dish towels (although they did provide a nice set of dish cleaning supplies), steep stairs with narrow treads that make it difficult and a bit iffy to haul luggage in and out, remote so dirty it grossed us out too bad to even use the tv, etc. I’ll stop there, you get the point. I just feel for the money we paid, dealing with that stuff was a big ask.  <br/><br/>The host was polite and courteous and did respond to my messages promptly. I think this could be a decent stay if the hosts could fix most of the items I mentioned. We left a week early, losing money, and don’t regret it.""]",4.7,4.5,4.9,4.7,4.7,4.6,4:00:00 PM,10:00:00 AM,2,Entire rental unit,1,1,1 bedroom,1 bed,1 bathroom

The location simply cannot be beat. Overlooking the Gateway mall, you are footsteps away from shops, restaurants, and even a small grocery store. There are fun activities available each weekday night during the summer (yoga/pilates classes, free movie night at the mall, dance classes); a short walk to the farmers market on Saturdays; occasional weekend events and only a 30 minute drive to Park City for epic hiking.  For the air bnb itself, the place was exactly as listed, scenic views from the balcony, quiet neighbors and for those working while traveling…fast wifi and even a small desk with a computer monitor (major plus!).

The hosts were super at communicating with us and checking in to see if all was good. <br/><br/>Some things that were mentioned in other reviews:<br/><br/>The staircase in the loft is a little steep but this just requires you to always use the handrail - That was good for us. Tall folks might have a little difficulty in the top level but you quickly get use to that. <br/><br/>If you are staying in the summer. A small tilted floor fan at the floor vent by the entry door will cool the upstairs perfectly - it was the perfect solution. Tilt the fan in the direction to blow the cool air from the floor vent to the upstairs. Also, we removed the thick comforter from the bed upstairs. We bring our own sheets and light blanket for summer stays. <br/><br/>We did not find the homeless issue to be a problem. SLC does a great job in managing the homeless and many of the homeless folks we encountered were calm and polite. <br/><br/>The neighbors in the complex were very kind and helpful.

The front door faces an interior courtyard. It’s an old mill building so just keep that in mind!<br/>- stair case to loft is steep. So be careful! Second floor has short ceiling.

The views from the apartment, back and front yards and deck were breathtaking—-day and night.  It is situated in a beautiful, safe, friendly neighborhood. The birds were always singing and spring flowers were in bloom.<br/><br/>The apartment was immaculate, fully furnished, very comfortable and inviting.<br/>The rooms are quite spacious with large windows providing sunlight and incredible mountain views. <br/>The kitchen is updated with granite countertops, a nice bar area and a huge pantry.

It is an easy drive to downtown SLC, Antelope Island and the Great Salt Lake.  Park City is about 30 minutes away.<br/><br/>This is my recommendation if you want to experience a little piece of Heaven on earth.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no negative comments. I give it a 5+ rating."",""I had always wanted to ski 30 days straight and when you are 71 years old, you can't put it off any longer.  I was lucky enough to find this charming 3-bedroom apartment near Big Cottonwood Canyon.  It was perfect in every way.  It is located a half-mile to the 6200-South park and ride (where the ski bus stops), a short 20-minute ride to four terrific ski areas and is near dozens of restaurants. <br/><br/>The apartment was exactly as presented. There are three roomy bedrooms with big closets (for your ski gear) and one with amazing views of the Salt Lake Valley.  My granddaughters will not soon forget the twinkling lights of the city. The kitchen is well-equipped and the living room is comfortable.  A nice hot tub helps soothe the tired muscles after a day on the slopes.<br/><br/>The hosts are terrific and the unit is both perfect and a great value.  I give this place five stars and two thumbs up!  I shall return."",""KJ's place is fantastic. It is extremely well located for anybody hoping to stay close to the mountains. You will feel right at home in the spacious apartment that has a very comfortable open layout. Even if you have many guests, you will not find yourself pressed for space. The beds are comfortable, and having three separate bedrooms really made having several guests totally manageable and comfortable - not your typical ski house situation with people on couches and air mattresses! The views from the apartment are to die for! Having coffee with the breathtaking views at KJ's will be something that I will miss dearly.<br/><br/>The location is extremely close to skiing. I was working from home throughout my stay and was able to get away from the Airbnb to both Alta and Brighton in less than 20 minutes! It is truly a skiers paradise.<br/><br/>The space is very well isolated from the owners upstairs and I felt like I had my own private space when staying at KJ's.

Tons of restaurants and local breweries in walking distance in sugar house . The house was cute with all appliances and cooking materials needed. Loved the linens provided, and stylish design! Beds are a little soft, but everything else was amazing! Ali was so flexible and responsive- she even tried to help us find an additional place to stay when we wanted to extend our trip. Would definitely recommend and come back!"",""Ali's spot was the perfect getaway, located nearby mountain access, and in a fun neighborhood in Salt Lake. The house is nice and private, located off the street and surrounded by a large fence, so it stays quiet and has an almost hidden \""oasis\"" sort of feel to it, without being remote. A handful of great shops, grocery stores, and restaurants/breweries are located within a 5-10 minute walk. <br/><br/>The location was perfect for quick trips into the mountains, with a handful of great ski resorts only a 20-30 minute drive from door to parking lot, and the base of the mountains and some trailheads maybe 10-15 minutes away. <br/><br/>The house itself was a clean and cozy, the bed in the master bedroom was incredibly comfortable, and the patio outside was perfect for evening hangs. <br/><br/>Ali was very responsive, friendly and accommodating, and was very respectful of privacy while still making sure she was available to be reached in case she was needed.<br/><br/>All-in, the spot was great, and I would definitely stay here again.""]",4.8,5,5,5,5,5,2:00:00 PM,2:00:00 PM,4,Home,2,1,2 bedrooms,2 beds,1 bathroom

We stayed for 2 months - my husband and I both WFH and overall this place was great. <br/>First - the place itself is super cute and in the perfect part of town. You can walk to a lot of great restaurants or take the bus downtown easily. The neighbors are friendly and it’s safe - I went on a lot of walks around the area.<br/>Second - the house itself worked out well. The working space in the back was chilly in the winter but we used a space heater so we could work from there. A note that it’s a standing desk but we were fine with that. The wifi was fast which is a big deal for us with working from home. The kitchen has all you need (note, no microwave if you use one often but we made do just fine) and the butler pantry has fun glassware to make coffee or cocktails. The fenced in yard was great and we sat on the front porch whenever it was nice out and met the neighbors. We also were there in the winter so we loved having the gas fireplace.<br/>Third - Elle and Garret are wonderful hosts who were super responsive if we needed anything. They gave us lots of great local recommendations and we feel like we got the full Salt Lake City experience. If you’re looking to stay in the city with short drives to skiing, this is your place."",""Our stay at Elle and Garret’s was fantastic! This is their home and it feels that way,  it’s not like staying in an AirBnB. Their place has so much character and served as a terrific home base for our one month stay in Salt Lake. We went camping in the surrounding national parks every weekend and they were nice enough to leave a camping stove and cooler which made our trips that much more enjoyable. The location was perfect for taking walks to Liberty Park, enjoying the restaurants of 9th and 9th, and great access to road bike rides like City Creek and Emmigration. <br/><br/>The kitchen was fully equipped and we enjoyed making dinner, then sitting out on the front porch to eat each night. The grill was also very nice for bbq nights. We made the mini fridge our beer fridge and collected great beers from the surrounding breweries. I was at first concerned about the tub/shower, especially as a 6’ 5” guy, but had no problems and my head even fit under the shower with some slight bending of the knees. The beds were very comfortable and in the hot summer heat the A/C worked great. We worked from the dining room table and alternated taking calls from the porch or kitchen if we had overlapping calls. Our favorite place to hang out was on the front porch on the couch or chairs. Their neighbors are so friendly and great to talk to. Lots of cute dogs passing by to say hello to. <br/><br/>Lastly, Elle and Garret are really nice people. We were able to have drinks together one night. They had so many recommendations for things to do and see. Garret even took me on a road bike ride and introduced me to some other riders in the area. They were always available and so helpful and friendly. <br/><br/>A couple of things that took some getting used to: <br/>1. The location of the silverware, it’s really not a big deal, but it’s in the dinning area not the kitchen. <br/>2. The back door locks when closed, luckily we didn’t lock ourselves out once, but we were close! <br/>3. The closet is in the back room. For two mix-gender friends this meant having to keep a set of clothes in our bedroom each night and also getting the clothes from the back room to bring them to a bedroom to change. The closet area is large and was great for storing all kinds of gear. <br/>4. We loved that they had a Google Home for music. We did realize that we were playing off Elle’s Spotify and sometimes we we’re trying to listen to Taylor Swift at the same time, which Spotify doesn’t allow. So you may have to set up the Google Home with your own Spotify so you can jam out to Taylor, Yacht Rock or whatever floats your boat. <br/><br/>If you have the opportunity to stay here do it! You won’t regret the experience and the comfort in Salt Lake City."",""Elle and Garret's home is everything we wanted for our stay in SLC, and more! The house is in a quiet neighborhood with very friendly neighbors and walking distance to a number of restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, and Liberty Park. And getting downtown is a short bike or Uber ride away. The house is well stocked with everything you could need for a short or long stay. My girlfriend and I worked the whole month we were there and never had one issue with the wifi, it is incredibly fast and reliable! We loved sipping coffee on the front porch every morning and eating dinner in the backyard every evening.

There are lots of beautiful trees surrounding the cottage, so it feels very private. It is within walking distance of silver lake and the Brighton ski area. So many hiking trails in walking distance. The house was clean and cozy. It had everything we needed. The lights were very bright and kept the house well-lit. The furniture was all very comfortable. One of the bedrooms had a memory foam kind of mattress. The bedrooms were small, but that doesn't bother me.""]",5,4.9,5,5,5,4.9,4:00:00 PM,10:00:00 AM,5,Entire cottage,3,1,2 bedrooms,3 beds,1 bathroom

The neighborhood is well kept, quiet & the neighbors we met while walking our dogs were friendly. The view of the mountains is breathtaking & Sugar House Park is a short drive away.

If you are looking to stay in the most gracious, beautiful mansion you've ever seen, book this. I was sad that I was here for a work trip and my husband wasn't with me! \r<br/>\r<br/>The house itself is a massive old mansion on a beautiful street with other historical mansions. It's near the fanciest part of town, which looks over Salt Lake City. It's about a 40 minute walk to downtown (or short uber/bus/drive). Right near the U of Utah, with a number of cute restaurants. There is an amazing walking/hiking/biking trail about 15 minutes up the hill from the mansion. \r<br/>\r<br/>Now on to the mansion: there are no words to describe this place accurately. It's stunning; perfectly maintained, stunning artwork on every well with custom lighting, antique furniture, beautiful decorations. I booked the master suite, and had a sitting room(!), a dressing room, a bathroom with every single amenity (including a bidet) and a massive bedroom space. I wanted to move in permanently. I felt like I was in a fairy tale. Would be a beautiful place to spend a weekend on vacation. The bed was a king and quite comfortable. Good AC. Daybed also in the master for an additional person or child. \r<br/>\r<br/>My colleague stayed in a bedroom across the hall, and that room was equally stunning. All have private baths. The downstairs area includes a full kitchen, a stunning dining room, an office, and several other common spaces. I worked in the massive office one evening while enjoying a glass of wine. \r<br/>\r<br/>Michael, the host, is wonderful, and was so kind and welcoming. He made me feel at home in this amazing place. \r<br/>\r<br/>Don't hesitate to book this. I can't imagine there is a single place better in the city (that wouldn't be possible, you'll see).

The host also left nivea lotion and peppermint chapstick as a welcome gift which was thoughtful.   Great location with tons of restaurants, a park, and a strip mall all within walking distance.

AC got a little loud during the hottest days, however everything else was perfect and very comfortable. Everything you need is here!<br/><br/> Great fully stocked kitchen. I don’t eat out so I appreciated this very much, as well as the pans and pots that were very well taken care of ( not old and peeling which is what I’ve noticed a lot of other hosts tend to provide and is super toxic )<br/><br/>I loved every detail, including how the toilet’s lid didn’t slam shut. Plenty of nice towels that weren’t falling apart. <br/><br/>Extremely  comfortable bedding and pillows without that way too common toxic bleach scent. Super comfy living room. Great work space and wifi. <br/><br/>You can tell they care!  I also appreciated no shoes inside.
